      <h2>SAVING AND RE-USING PRECOMPILED PCRE PATTERNS</h2>

      <p>If you are running an application that uses a large number
      of regular expression patterns, it may be useful to store
      them in a precompiled form instead of having to compile them
      every time the application is run. If you are not using any
      private character tables (see the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre_maketables()</span>(3)</span>
      documentation), this is relatively straightforward. If you
      are using private tables, it is a little bit more
      complicated. However, if you are using the just-in-time
      optimization feature, it is not possible to save and reload
      the JIT data.</p>

      <p>If you save compiled patterns to a file, you can copy them
      to a different host and run them there. If the two hosts have
      different endianness (byte order), you should run the
      <code class="function">pcre[16]_pattern_to_host_byte_order</code>()
      function on the new host before trying to match the pattern.
      The matching functions return PCRE_ERROR_BADENDIANNESS if
      they detect a pattern with the wrong endianness.</p>

      <p>Compiling regular expressions with one version of PCRE for
      use with a different version is not guaranteed to work and
      may cause crashes, and saving and restoring a compiled
      pattern loses any JIT optimization data.</p>

      <a id="pcreprecompile-3_sect2" name="pcreprecompile-3_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>SAVING A COMPILED PATTERN</h2>

      <p>The value returned by <code class="function">pcre[16]_compile</code>() points to a single block
      of memory that holds the compiled pattern and associated
      data. You can find the length of this block in bytes by
      calling <code class="function">pcre[16]_fullinfo</code>()
      with an argument of PCRE_INFO_SIZE. You can then save the
      data in any appropriate manner. Here is sample code for the
      8-bit library that compiles a pattern and writes it to a
      file. It assumes that the variable <code class="varname">fd</code> refers to a file that is open for
      output:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 int erroroffset, rc, size;
 char *error;
 pcre *re;
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 re = pcre_compile("my pattern", 0, &amp;error, &amp;erroroffset, NULL);
 if (re == NULL) { ... handle errors ... }
 rc = pcre_fullinfo(re, NULL, PCRE_INFO_SIZE, &amp;size);
 if (rc &lt; 0) { ... handle errors ... }
 rc = fwrite(re, 1, size, fd);
 if (rc != size) { ... handle errors ... }
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>In this example, the bytes that comprise the compiled
      pattern are copied exactly. Note that this is binary data
      that may contain any of the 256 possible byte values. On
      systems that make a distinction between binary and non-binary
      data, be sure that the file is opened for binary output.</p>

      <p>If you want to write more than one pattern to a file, you
      will have to devise a way of separating them. For binary
      data, preceding each pattern with its length is probably the
      most straightforward approach. Another possibility is to
      write out the data in hexadecimal instead of binary, one
      pattern to a line.</p>

      <p>Saving compiled patterns in a file is only one possible
      way of storing them for later use. They could equally well be
      saved in a database, or in the memory of some daemon process
      that passes them via sockets to the processes that want
      them.</p>

      <p>If the pattern has been studied, it is also possible to
      save the normal study data in a similar way to the compiled
      pattern itself. However, if the PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE was
      used, the just-in-time data that is created cannot be saved
      because it is too dependent on the current environment. When
      studying generates additional information, <code class="function">pcre[16]_study</code>() returns a pointer to a
      <em class="replaceable"><code>pcre[16]_extra</code></em> data
      block. Its format is defined in the section on matching a
      pattern in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a> documentation.
      The <code class="varname">study_data</code> field points to
      the binary study data, and this is what you must save (not
      the <em class="replaceable"><code>pcre[16]_extra</code></em>
      block itself). The length of the study data can be obtained
      by calling <code class="function">pcre[16]_fullinfo</code>()
      with an argument of PCRE_INFO_STUDYSIZE. Remember to check
      that <code class="function">pcre[16]_study</code>() did
      return a non-NULL value before trying to save the study
      data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="RE-USING A PRECOMPILED PATTERN">
      <a id="pcreprecompile-3_sect3" name="pcreprecompile-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>RE-USING A PRECOMPILED PATTERN</h2>

      <p>Re-using a precompiled pattern is straightforward. Having
      reloaded it into main memory, called <code class="function">pcre[16]_pattern_to_host_byte_order</code>() if
      necessary, you pass its pointer to <code class="function">pcre[16]_exec</code>() or <code class="function">pcre[16]_dfa_exec</code>() in the usual way.</p>

      <p>However, if you passed a pointer to custom character
      tables when the pattern was compiled (the <em class="parameter"><code>tableptr</code></em> argument of
      <code class="function">pcre[16]_compile</code>()), you must
      now pass a similar pointer to <code class="function">pcre[16]_exec</code>() or <code class="function">pcre[16]_dfa_exec</code>(), because the value
      saved with the compiled pattern will obviously be nonsense. A
      field in a <code class="function">pcre[16]_extra</code>()
      block is used to pass this data, as described in the section
      on matching a pattern in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>

      <p>If you did not provide custom character tables when the
      pattern was compiled, the pointer in the compiled pattern is
      NULL, which causes the matching functions to use PCRE's
      internal tables. Thus, you do not need to take any special
      action at run time in this case.</p>

      <p>If you saved study data with the compiled pattern, you
      need to create your own <em class="replaceable"><code>pcre[16]_extra</code></em> data block and
      set the <code class="varname">study_data</code> field to
      point to the reloaded study data. You must also set the
      PCRE_EXTRA_STUDY_DATA bit in the <code class="varname">flags</code> field to indicate that study data is
      present. Then pass the <em class="replaceable"><code>pcre[16]_extra</code></em> block to the
      matching function in the usual way. If the pattern was
      studied for just-in-time optimization, that data cannot be
      saved, and so is lost by a save/restore cycle.</p>

      <h2>COMPATIBILITY WITH DIFFERENT PCRE RELEASES</h2>

      <p>In general, it is safest to recompile all saved patterns
      when you update to a new PCRE release, though not all updates
      actually require this.</p>
