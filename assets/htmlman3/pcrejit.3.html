      <h2>PCRE JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>Just-in-time compiling is a heavyweight optimization that
      can greatly speed up pattern matching. However, it comes at
      the cost of extra processing before the match is performed.
      Therefore, it is of most benefit when the same pattern is
      going to be matched many times. This does not necessarily
      mean many calls of a matching function; if the pattern is not
      anchored, matching attempts may take place many times at
      various positions in the subject, even for a single call.
      Therefore, if the subject string is very long, it may still
      pay to use JIT for one-off matches.</p>

      <p>JIT support applies only to the traditional
      Perl-compatible matching function. It does not apply when the
      DFA matching function is being used. The code for this
      support was written by Zoltan Herczeg.</p>

      <h2>8-BIT and 16-BIT SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>JIT support is available for both the 8-bit and 16-bit
      PCRE libraries. To keep this documentation simple, only the
      8-bit interface is described in what follows. If you are
      using the 16-bit library, substitute the 16-bit functions and
      16-bit structures (for example, <code class="function">pcre16_jit_stack</code> instead of <code class="function">pcre_jit_stack</code>).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="AVAILABILITY OF JIT SUPPORT">
      <a id="pcrejit-3_sect3" name="pcrejit-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>AVAILABILITY OF JIT SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>JIT support is an optional feature of PCRE. The
      "configure" option --enable-jit (or equivalent CMake option)
      must be set when PCRE is built if you want to use JIT. The
      support is limited to the following hardware platforms:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 ARM v5, v7, and Thumb2
 Intel x86 32-bit and 64-bit
 MIPS 32-bit
 Power PC 32-bit and 64-bit
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If --enable-jit is set on an unsupported platform,
      compilation fails.</p>

      <p>A program that is linked with PCRE 8.20 or later can tell
      if JIT support is available by calling <code class="function">pcre_config</code>() with the PCRE_CONFIG_JIT
      option. The result is 1 when JIT is available, and 0
      otherwise. However, a simple program does not need to check
      this in order to use JIT. The API is implemented in a way
      that falls back to the interpretive code if JIT is not
      available.</p>

      <p>If your program may sometimes be linked with versions of
      PCRE that are older than 8.20, but you want to use JIT when
      it is available, you can test the values of PCRE_MAJOR and
      PCRE_MINOR, or the existence of a JIT macro such as
      PCRE_CONFIG_JIT, for compile-time control of your code.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="SIMPLE USE OF JIT">
      <a id="pcrejit-3_sect4" name="pcrejit-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>SIMPLE USE OF JIT</h2>

      <p>You have to do two things to make use of the JIT support
      in the simplest way:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (1) Call <code class="function">pcre_study</code>() with the PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE option for
     each compiled pattern, and pass the resulting <code class="function">pcre_extra</code> block to
     <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>().
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (2) Use <code class="function">pcre_free_study</code>() to free the <code class="function">pcre_extra</code> block when it is
     no longer needed, instead of just freeing it yourself. This
     ensures that any JIT data is also freed.
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>For a program that may be linked with pre-8.20 versions of
      PCRE, you can insert</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 #ifndef PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE
 #define PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE 0
 #endif
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>so that no option is passed to <code class="function">pcre_study</code>(), and then use something like
      this to free the study data:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 #ifdef PCRE_CONFIG_JIT
     pcre_free_study(study_ptr);
 #else
     pcre_free(study_ptr);
 #endif
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE requests the JIT compiler to
      generate code for complete matches. If you want to run
      partial matches using the PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD or
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT options of <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(), you should set one or both of
      the following options in addition to, or instead of,
      PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE when you call <code class="function">pcre_study</code>():</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 PCRE_STUDY_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD_COMPILE
 PCRE_STUDY_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT_COMPILE
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The JIT compiler generates different optimized code for
      each of the three modes (normal, soft partial, hard partial).
      When <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is called, the
      appropriate code is run if it is available. Otherwise, the
      pattern is matched using interpretive code.</p>

      <p>In some circumstances you may need to call additional
      functions. These are described in the section entitled
      "Controlling the JIT stack" below.</p>

      <p>If JIT support is not available, PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE
      etc. are ignored, and no JIT data is created. Otherwise, the
      compiled pattern is passed to the JIT compiler, which turns
      it into machine code that executes much faster than the
      normal interpretive code. When <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is passed a <code class="function">pcre_extra</code> block containing a pointer to
      JIT code of the appropriate mode (normal or hard/soft
      partial), it obeys that code instead of running the
      interpreter. The result is identical, but the compiled JIT
      code runs much faster.</p>

      <p>There are some <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>()
      options that are not supported for JIT execution. There are
      also some pattern items that JIT cannot handle. Details are
      given below. In both cases, execution automatically falls
      back to the interpretive code. If you want to know whether
      JIT was actually used for a particular match, you should
      arrange for a JIT callback function to be set up as described
      in the section entitled "Controlling the JIT stack" below,
      even if you do not need to supply a non-default JIT stack.
      Such a callback function is called whenever JIT code is about
      to be obeyed. If the execution options are not right for JIT
      execution, the callback function is not obeyed.</p>

      <p>If the JIT compiler finds an unsupported item, no JIT data
      is generated. You can find out if JIT execution is available
      after studying a pattern by calling <code class="function">pcre_fullinfo</code>() with the PCRE_INFO_JIT
      option. A result of 1 means that JIT compilation was
      successful. A result of 0 means that JIT support is not
      available, or the pattern was not studied with
      PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE etc., or the JIT compiler was not able
      to handle the pattern.</p>

      <p>Once a pattern has been studied, with or without JIT, it
      can be used as many times as you like for matching different
      subject strings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS AND PATTERN ITEMS">
      <a id="pcrejit-3_sect5" name="pcrejit-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS AND PATTERN ITEMS</h2>

      <p>The only <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() options
      that are supported for JIT execution are PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK,
      PCRE_NO_UTF16_CHECK, PCRE_NOTBOL, PCRE_NOTEOL, PCRE_NOTEMPTY,
      PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART, PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD, and
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT.</p>

      <p>The unsupported pattern items are:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \C             match a single byte; not supported in UTF-8 mode

 (*PRUNE)       )
 (*SKIP)        ) backtracking control verbs
 (*THEN)        )
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Support for some of these may be added in future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="RETURN VALUES FROM JIT EXECUTION">
      <a id="pcrejit-3_sect6" name="pcrejit-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>RETURN VALUES FROM JIT EXECUTION</h2>

      <p>When a pattern is matched using JIT execution, the return
      values are the same as those given by the interpretive
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() code, with the
      addition of one new error code: PCRE_ERROR_JIT_STACKLIMIT.
      This means that the memory used for the JIT stack was
      insufficient. See "Controlling the JIT stack" below for a
      discussion of JIT stack usage. For compatibility with the
      interpretive <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() code,
      no more than two-thirds of the <code class="function">ovector</code> argument is used for passing back
      captured substrings.</p>

      <p>The error code PCRE_ERROR_MATCHLIMIT is returned by the
      JIT code if searching a very large pattern tree goes on for
      too long, as it is in the same circumstance when JIT is not
      used, but the details of exactly what is counted are not the
      same. The PCRE_ERROR_RECURSIONLIMIT error code is never
      returned by JIT execution.</p>

      <h2>SAVING AND RESTORING COMPILED PATTERNS</h2>

      <p>The code that is generated by the JIT compiler is
      architecture-specific, and is also position dependent. For
      those reasons it cannot be saved (in a file or database) and
      restored later like the bytecode and other data of a compiled
      pattern. Saving and restoring compiled patterns is not
      something many people do. More detail about this facility is
      given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreprecompile.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreprecompile</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation. It should be possible to run <code class="function">pcre_study</code>() on a saved and restored
      pattern, and thereby recreate the JIT data, but because JIT
      compilation uses significant resources, it is probably not
      worth doing this; you might as well recompile the original
      pattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="CONTROLLING THE JIT STACK">
      <a id="pcrejit-3_sect8" name="pcrejit-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CONTROLLING THE JIT STACK</h2>

      <p>When the compiled JIT code runs, it needs a block of
      memory to use as a stack. By default, it uses 32K on the
      machine stack. However, some large or complicated patterns
      need more than this. The error PCRE_ERROR_JIT_STACKLIMIT is
      given when there is not enough stack. Three functions are
      provided for managing blocks of memory for use as JIT stacks.
      There is further discussion about the use of JIT stacks in
      the section entitled "JIT stack FAQ" below.</p>

      <p>The <code class="function">pcre_jit_stack_alloc</code>()
      function creates a JIT stack. Its arguments are a starting
      size and a maximum size, and it returns a pointer to an
      opaque structure of type <code class="function">pcre_jit_stack</code>, or NULL if there is an
      error. The <code class="function">pcre_jit_stack_free</code>() function can be used
      to free a stack that is no longer needed. (For the
      technically minded: the address space is allocated by mmap or
      VirtualAlloc.)</p>

      <p>JIT uses far less memory for recursion than the
      interpretive code, and a maximum stack size of 512K to 1M
      should be more than enough for any pattern.</p>

      <p>The <code class="function">pcre_assign_jit_stack</code>()
      function specifies which stack JIT code should use. Its
      arguments are as follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 pcre_extra         *extra
 pcre_jit_callback  callback
 void               *data
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The <code class="function">extra</code> argument must be
      the result of studying a pattern with PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE
      etc. There are three cases for the values of the other two
      options:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (1) If <code class="function">callback</code> is NULL and <code class="function">data</code> is NULL, an internal 32K block
     on the machine stack is used.
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (2) If <code class="function">callback</code> is NULL and <code class="function">data</code> is not NULL, <code class="function">data</code> must be
     a valid JIT stack, the result of calling <code class="function">pcre_jit_stack_alloc</code>().
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (3) If <code class="function">callback</code> is not NULL, it must point to a function that is
     called with <code class="function">data</code> as an argument at the start of matching, in
     order to set up a JIT stack. If the return from the callback
     function is NULL, the internal 32K stack is used; otherwise the
     return value must be a valid JIT stack, the result of calling
     <code class="function">pcre_jit_stack_alloc</code>().
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>A callback function is obeyed whenever JIT code is about
      to be run; it is not obeyed when <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is called with options that are
      incompatible for JIT execution. A callback function can
      therefore be used to determine whether a match operation was
      executed by JIT or by the interpreter.</p>

      <p>You may safely use the same JIT stack for more than one
      pattern (either by assigning directly or by callback), as
      long as the patterns are all matched sequentially in the same
      thread. In a multithread application, if you do not specify a
      JIT stack, or if you assign or pass back NULL from a
      callback, that is thread-safe, because each thread has its
      own machine stack. However, if you assign or pass back a
      non-NULL JIT stack, this must be a different stack for each
      thread so that the application is thread-safe.</p>

      <p>Strictly speaking, even more is allowed. You can assign
      the same non-NULL stack to any number of patterns as long as
      they are not used for matching by multiple threads at the
      same time. For example, you can assign the same stack to all
      compiled patterns, and use a global mutex in the callback to
      wait until the stack is available for use. However, this is
      an inefficient solution, and not recommended.</p>

      <p>This is a suggestion for how a multithreaded program that
      needs to set up non-default JIT stacks might operate:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 During thread initalization
   thread_local_var = pcre_jit_stack_alloc(...)
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 During thread exit
   pcre_jit_stack_free(thread_local_var)
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 Use a one-line callback function
   return thread_local_var
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>All the functions described in this section do nothing if
      JIT is not available, and <code class="function">pcre_assign_jit_stack</code>() does nothing unless
      the <code class="function">extra</code> argument is non-NULL
      and points to a <code class="function">pcre_extra</code>
      block that is the result of a successful study with
      PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE etc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="JIT STACK FAQ">
      <a id="pcrejit-3_sect9" name="pcrejit-3_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>JIT STACK FAQ</h2>

      <p>(1) Why do we need JIT stacks?</p>

      <p>PCRE (and JIT) is a recursive, depth-first engine, so it
      needs a stack where the local data of the current node is
      pushed before checking its child nodes. Allocating real
      machine stack on some platforms is difficult. For example,
      the stack chain needs to be updated every time if we extend
      the stack on PowerPC. Although it is possible, its updating
      time overhead decreases performance. So we do the recursion
      in memory.</p>

      <p>(2) Why don't we simply allocate blocks of memory with
      <code class="function">malloc</code>()?</p>

      <p>Modern operating systems have a nice feature: they can
      reserve an address space instead of allocating memory. We can
      safely allocate memory pages inside this address space, so
      the stack could grow without moving memory data (this is
      important because of pointers). Thus we can allocate 1M
      address space, and use only a single memory page (usually 4K)
      if that is enough. However, we can still grow up to 1M
      anytime if needed.</p>

      <p>(3) Who "owns" a JIT stack?</p>

      <p>The owner of the stack is the user program, not the JIT
      studied pattern or anything else. The user program must
      ensure that if a stack is used by <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(), (that is, it is assigned to
      the pattern currently running), that stack must not be used
      by any other threads (to avoid overwriting the same memory
      area). The best practice for multithreaded programs is to
      allocate a stack for each thread, and return this stack
      through the JIT callback function.</p>

      <p>(4) When should a JIT stack be freed?</p>

      <p>You can free a JIT stack at any time, as long as it will
      not be used by <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>()
      again. When you assign the stack to a pattern, only a pointer
      is set. There is no reference counting or any other magic.
      You can free the patterns and stacks in any order, anytime.
      Just <span class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> call
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() with a pattern
      pointing to an already freed stack, as that will cause
      SEGFAULT. (Also, do not free a stack currently used by
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() in another thread).
      You can also replace the stack for a pattern at any time. You
      can even free the previous stack before assigning a
      replacement.</p>

      <p>(5) Should I allocate/free a stack every time before/after
      calling <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>()?</p>

      <p>No, because this is too costly in terms of resources.
      However, you could implement some clever idea which release
      the stack if it is not used in let's say two minutes. The JIT
      callback can help to achive this without keeping a list of
      the currently JIT studied patterns.</p>

      <p>(6) OK, the stack is for long term memory allocation. But
      what happens if a pattern causes stack overflow with a stack
      of 1M? Is that 1M kept until the stack is freed?</p>

      <p>Especially on embedded sytems, it might be a good idea to
      release memory sometimes without freeing the stack. There is
      no API for this at the moment. Probably a function call which
      returns with the currently allocated memory for any stack and
      another which allows releasing memory (shrinking the stack)
      would be a good idea if someone needs this.</p>

      <p>(7) This is too much of a headache. Isn't there any better
      solution for JIT stack handling?</p>

      <p>No, thanks to Windows. If POSIX threads were used
      everywhere, we could throw out this complicated API.</p>
