      <h2>UTF-8, UTF-16, AND UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>From Release 8.30, in addition to its previous UTF-8
      support, PCRE also supports UTF-16 by means of a separate
      16-bit library. This can be built as well as, or instead of,
      the 8-bit library.</p>

    <div class="refsect1" title="UTF-8 SUPPORT">
      <a id="pcreunicode-3_sect2" name="pcreunicode-3_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>UTF-8 SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>In order process UTF-8 strings, you must build PCRE's
      8-bit library with UTF support, and, in addition, you must
      call <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre_compile()</span>(3)</span> with the
      PCRE_UTF8 option flag, or the pattern must start with the
      sequence (*UTF8). When either of these is the case, both the
      pattern and any subject strings that are matched against it
      are treated as UTF-8 strings instead of strings of 1-byte
      characters.</p>
    </div>

      <a id="pcreunicode-3_sect3" name="pcreunicode-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>UTF-16 SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>In order process UTF-16 strings, you must build PCRE's
      16-bit library with UTF support, and, in addition, you must
      call <code class="function">pcre16_compile</code>() with the
      PCRE_UTF16 option flag, or the pattern must start with the
      sequence (*UTF16). When either of these is the case, both the
      pattern and any subject strings that are matched against it
      are treated as UTF-16 strings instead of strings of 16-bit

      <h2>UTF SUPPORT OVERHEAD</h2>

      <p>If you compile PCRE with UTF support, but do not use it at
      run time, the library will be a bit bigger, but the
      additional run time overhead is limited to testing the
      PCRE_UTF8/16 flag occasionally, so should not be very
      big.</p>

    <div class="refsect1" title="UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT">
      <a id="pcreunicode-3_sect5" name="pcreunicode-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>If PCRE is built with Unicode character property support
      (which implies UTF support), the escape sequences \p{..},
      \P{..}, and \X can be used. The available properties that can
      be tested are limited to the general category properties such
      as Lu for an upper case letter or Nd for a decimal number,
      the Unicode script names such as Arabic or Han, and the
      derived properties Any and L&amp;. A full list is given in
      the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrepattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation. Only the short names for properties are
      supported. For example, \p{L} matches a letter. Its Perl
      synonym, \p{Letter}, is not supported. Furthermore, in Perl,
      many properties may optionally be prefixed by "Is", for
      compatibility with Perl 5.6. PCRE does not support this.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Validity of UTF-8 strings">
        <a id="pcreunicode-3_sect6" name="pcreunicode-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Validity of UTF-8 strings</h3>

        <p>When you set the PCRE_UTF8 flag, the byte strings passed
        as patterns and subjects are (by default) checked for
        validity on entry to the relevant functions. The entire
        string is checked before any other processing takes place.
        From release 7.3 of PCRE, the check is according the rules
        of RFC 3629, which are themselves derived from the Unicode
        specification. Earlier releases of PCRE followed the rules
        of RFC 2279, which allows the full range of 31-bit values
        (0 to 0x7FFFFFFF). The current check allows only values in
        the range U+0 to U+10FFFF, excluding U+D800 to U+DFFF.</p>

        <p>The excluded code points are the "Surrogate Area" of
        Unicode. They are reserved for use by UTF-16, where they
        are used in pairs to encode codepoints with values greater
        than 0xFFFF. The code points that are encoded by UTF-16
        pairs are available independently in the UTF-8 encoding.
        (In other words, the whole surrogate thing is a fudge for
        UTF-16 which unfortunately messes up UTF-8.)</p>

        <p>If an invalid UTF-8 string is passed to PCRE, an error
        return is given. At compile time, the only additional
        information is the offset to the first byte of the failing
        character. The run-time functions <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() and <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() also pass back this
        information, as well as a more detailed reason code if the
        caller has provided memory in which to do this.</p>

        <p>In some situations, you may already know that your
        strings are valid, and therefore want to skip these checks
        in order to improve performance, for example in the case of
        a long subject string that is being scanned repeatedly with
        different patterns. If you set the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK flag
        at compile time or at run time, PCRE assumes that the
        pattern or subject it is given (respectively) contains only
        valid UTF-8 codes. In this case, it does not diagnose an
        invalid UTF-8 string.</p>

        <p>If you pass an invalid UTF-8 string when
        PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK is set, what happens depends on why the
        string is invalid. If the string conforms to the "old"
        definition of UTF-8 (RFC 2279), it is processed as a string
        of characters in the range 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF by <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() and the interpreted
        version of <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(). In
        other words, apart from the initial validity test, these
        functions (when in UTF-8 mode) handle strings according to
        the more liberal rules of RFC 2279. However, the
        just-in-time (JIT) optimization for <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() supports only RFC 3629. If
        you are using JIT optimization, or if the string does not
        even conform to RFC 2279, the result is undefined. Your
        program may crash.</p>

        <p>If you want to process strings of values in the full
        range 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF, encoded in a UTF-8-like manner as
        per the old RFC, you can set PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK to bypass
        the more restrictive test. However, in this situation, you
        will have to apply your own validity check, and avoid the
        use of JIT optimization.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Validity of UTF-16 strings">
        <a id="pcreunicode-3_sect7" name="pcreunicode-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Validity of UTF-16 strings</h3>

        <p>When you set the PCRE_UTF16 flag, the strings of 16-bit
        data units that are passed as patterns and subjects are (by
        default) checked for validity on entry to the relevant
        functions. Values other than those in the surrogate range
        U+D800 to U+DFFF are independent code points. Values in the
        surrogate range must be used in pairs in the correct
        manner.</p>

        <p>If an invalid UTF-16 string is passed to PCRE, an error
        return is given. At compile time, the only additional
        information is the offset to the first data unit of the
        failing character. The run-time functions <code class="function">pcre16_exec</code>() and <code class="function">pcre16_dfa_exec</code>() also pass back this
        information, as well as a more detailed reason code if the
        caller has provided memory in which to do this.</p>

        <p>In some situations, you may already know that your
        strings are valid, and therefore want to skip these checks
        in order to improve performance. If you set the
        PCRE_NO_UTF16_CHECK flag at compile time or at run time,
        PCRE assumes that the pattern or subject it is given
        (respectively) contains only valid UTF-16 sequences. In
        this case, it does not diagnose an invalid UTF-16
        string.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="General comments about UTF modes">
        <a id="pcreunicode-3_sect8" name="pcreunicode-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>General comments about UTF modes</h3>

        <p>1. Codepoints less than 256 can be specified by either
        braced or unbraced hexadecimal escape sequences (for
        example, \x{b3} or \xb3). Larger values have to use braced
        sequences.</p>

        <p>2. Octal numbers up to \777 are recognized, and in UTF-8
        mode, they match two-byte characters for values greater
        than \177.</p>

        <p>3. Repeat quantifiers apply to complete UTF characters,
        not to individual data units, for example: \x{100}{3}.</p>

        <p>4. The dot metacharacter matches one UTF character
        instead of a single data unit.</p>

        <p>5. The escape sequence \C can be used to match a single
        byte in UTF-8 mode, or a single 16-bit data unit in UTF-16
        mode, but its use can lead to some strange effects because
        it breaks up multi-unit characters (see the description of
        \C in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrepattern</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation). The use of \C is not supported in the
        alternative matching function <code class="function">pcre[16]_dfa_exec</code>(), nor is it supported
        in UTF mode by the JIT optimization of <code class="function">pcre[16]_exec</code>(). If JIT optimization is
        requested for a UTF pattern that contains \C, it will not
        succeed, and so the matching will be carried out by the
        normal interpretive function.</p>

        <p>6. The character escapes \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and
        \W correctly test characters of any code value, but, by
        default, the characters that PCRE recognizes as digits,
        spaces, or word characters remain the same set as in
        non-UTF mode, all with values less than 256. This remains
        true even when PCRE is built to include Unicode property
        support, because to do otherwise would slow down PCRE in
        many common cases. Note in particular that this applies to
        \b and \B, because they are defined in terms of \w and \W.
        If you really want to test for a wider sense of, say,
        "digit", you can use explicit Unicode property tests such
        as \p{Nd}. Alternatively, if you set the PCRE_UCP option,
        the way that the character escapes work is changed so that
        Unicode properties are used to determine which characters
        match. There are more details in the section on generic
        character types in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrepattern</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation.</p>

        <p>7. Similarly, characters that match the POSIX named
        character classes are all low-valued characters, unless the
        PCRE_UCP option is set.</p>

        <p>8. However, the horizontal and vertical white space
        matching escapes (\h, \H, \v, and \V) do match all the
        appropriate Unicode characters, whether or not PCRE_UCP is
        set.</p>

        <p>9. Case-insensitive matching applies only to characters
        whose values are less than 128, unless PCRE is built with
        Unicode property support. Even when Unicode property
        support is available, PCRE still uses its own character
        tables when checking the case of low-valued characters, so
        as not to degrade performance. The Unicode property
        information is used only for characters with higher values.
        Furthermore, PCRE supports case-insensitive matching only
        when there is a one-to-one mapping between a letter's
        cases. There are a small number of many-to-one mappings in
        Unicode; these are not supported by PCRE.</p>
